    "## Use functions instead of scripts\n",
    "Whenever possible, use functions instead of scripts. This is because functions facilitate reuse, and functions are testable. Never use copy and paste for reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Names of variables and functions\n",
    "Use meaningful names for functions are variables. Function names should be verbs. For example, a function that calculates a fast Fourier transform might be named calcFFT. A bad name for this function would be the single letter f.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use named constants\n",
    "Constants used in the notebook should have a name in all capital letters. For example, use PI, not pi. (By definition, a constant is a variable that is assigned a value only once.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions\n",
    "1. **Each functions should be in a separate code cell.**\n",
    "1. **Functions must be documented.** A function should contain documentation that specifies: (a) what it does; (b) data types and semantics of its input parameters; (c) data type and semantics of what it returns.\n",
    "1. **Functions must have tests.** The code cell in which a function resides should contain an \"assert\" statement that runs the function and performs a test on its output."
